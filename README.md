# Paschi's dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. They are basically forked from
[Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)' great dotfiles. See the description for detailed infos.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hubeRsen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

Dont forget to set the standard shell to zsh (brew version). [How to do that](http://zanshin.net/2013/09/03/how-to-use-homebrew-zsh-instead-of-max-os-x-default/)

## thanks
